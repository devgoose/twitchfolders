/**
 *
 * Each folder has it's own mapping to all of the channels that belong under it, as such:
 *
 * "folders": "{"folder1": ["channel1", "channel2", "channel3"],
 *              "folder2": ["channel4", "channel5", "channel6"],
 *              ...,
 *              "tf": "channel7,channel8,channel9"
 *
 * "order": "channel1,channel2,channel3..."
 *
 * Order is persisted with the "order" attribute and the order can be gotten from split()
 *
 * These mappings make it quick to get a folder's list of channels with just the folder's name.
 *
 * You can fetch and change a folder's channels like this:
 *
 * var mappings;
 * var channels;
 * chrome.storage.sync.get(['folders'], function(result) {
 *      mappings = JSON.parse(result.folders);                          //Fetch mappings
 *      channels = mappings.folder1;                                    //Fetch list of channels for a folder
 *      channels.push("newChannel");                                    //Add new channel
 *      chrome.storage.sync.set({"folders": JSON.stringify(mappings)}); //Write it back
 * })
 *
 * Again, remember that 'folder' is a string and 'channels' is an array of strings.
